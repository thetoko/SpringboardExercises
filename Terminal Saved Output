Part II
1. The man command is the command that pulls up the manual for specific function. 
 Scroll man using keys or arrows and to get out use the "q" letter
2. Man ls:      -L      Follow all symbolic links to final target and list the file or
             directory the link references rather than the link itself.  This
             option cancels the -P option.
		-A      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (‘.’) except
             for . and ...  Automatically set for the super-user unless -I is
             specified.


3. Jump between words using option and arrow keys left or right
4. Control + E to get to the end of a line
5. Control + A
6. Option + Delete
7. The terminal is a program with an interface to the shell. The shell is what processes the commands and function.
8. Absolute path is the complete address including the root in the computer
9. Relative path includes access in the current location that the terminal is in
10. Flag adds another function to a command: -rm flag overrides when using to remove, -a listed above includes .directory entries. -l flag lists down files and folders in sorted order

11. -r flag with rm : remove folders and everything in it; -f will force removal of folder and the files.
